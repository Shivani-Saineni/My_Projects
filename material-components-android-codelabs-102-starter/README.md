MDC-102 Android: Material Structure and Layout (Java)

A login page is created in Codelab MDC-101 using two Material Components (MDC): buttons and text fields. Now, adding navigation, structure, and data is made easier with the help of this foundation.


In this codelab the home screen is created for the e-commerce app Shrine, which sells apparel and household items. 
It will include:

* A top app bar
* A product grid list
