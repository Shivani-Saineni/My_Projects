# Academic Projects

Hello and welcome to my repository of academic projects! 

All of the projects I've worked on over my academic career are collected in this repository. It is evidence of my development, growth, and multiple skill set.
Every project has its own directory. It contains the source code and an README outlining the details of the project.

This repository offers a thorough understanding of my technical proficiency, aptitude for solving problems, and enthusiasm for picking up and using new technologies.

Thank you for visiting my repository. Happy exploring!
