MDC-101 Android: Material Components (MDC) Basics (Java)

Building bold and beautiful digital products is made possible with the help of Material Design. Product teams may reach their full design potential by bringing style, branding, interaction, and motion together under a single set of guidelines and elements.

Material Components for Android (MDC Android) is an Android application component framework that combines engineering and design to create consistency throughout your application. These parts are updated in line with the Material Design system's evolution to guarantee pixel-perfect implementation and compliance with Google's front-end development guidelines. Moreover, MDC is accessible for Flutter, iOS, and the web.

In this project we will build a login page for Shrine (name of the APP) App with several MDC Andriod Components such as 
* Two text fields for entering Username and Password. 
* Two buttons are used one for Cancel and other for Next.
* It also contains Shrine's logo image.
