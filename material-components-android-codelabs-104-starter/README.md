MDC-104 Android: Material Advanced Components (Java)

Like a button, a component in the Material Design system has certain properties and executes a predetermined set of activities. 
But a button isn't simply a mechanism for the user to do an activity; it's also a shape, size, and color representation that indicates to the user that it's interactive and that when they touch or click, something will happen.

Components are described from a designer's perspective in the Material Design guidelines. They outline the several fundamental features that are common to all platforms and the anatomical parts that comprise each one. 

A backdrop, for example, has display choices, motion rules, a front layer and its content, and a back layer. 
For the purposes, use cases, and content of any app, each of these elements can be modified. Most of these components are standard views, controls, and SDK operations from your platform.

Although numerous components are listed in the Material Design standards, not all of them are suitable candidates for reusable code and are consequently absent from MDC. Using conventional code, you may craft these experiences yourself to give your app a unique look.
